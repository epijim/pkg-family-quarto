    I continue my long search for a way to generate a nicely formatted
    website with publication list based on adding publication information to a single source of truth
    without re-remembering how all the formatting works each time.

# Intro

I've never been good at keeping my website updated. I always go through two different phases of maintenance:

1. Rushing around creating a new website with bells and whistles using whatever the flavor of the month is
2. Never updating an existing website

I'm hoping to break out of this cycle, but am currently solidly within Phase 1.
