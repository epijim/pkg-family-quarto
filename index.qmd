### What is this site?

> THIS SECTION WOULD BE DELETED - JUST TO EXPLAIN PoC

This is a PoC - hacked together on a Sunday morning. The only thing the website maintainer needs to 
maintain is the summary (as a markdown file) below this text, then a YAML
file that lists the packages that make up this family of packages. An example 
entry is below for teal. Everything else (the people, packages and functions pages)
are generated on the fly by scraping the package docs and github repos.

There is also a blog section (could be disabled).

```yaml
- title: "teal"
  description: |
    Here is some text on teal.
    And this is a new line.
  website: https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal
  github: https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal
```

This site is a fork of https://github.com/ddimmery/quarto-website, the packages 
page is almost the same, but functions and people are new.

### What is admiral?

> THIS SECTION IS A SIMPLE MARKDOWN FILE TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT ON HOW THE PACKAGE FIT TOGETHER

*"In keeping with the Pharma Vision, our mission is to enable Data Sciences to analyze faster"*

Here we can put a bunch of text in markdown format about what admiral is as a 
pan-package family. We can add images, meme gifs- etc. Anything that flys in markdown.
